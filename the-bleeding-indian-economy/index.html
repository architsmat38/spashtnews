                    <div class="article-post text-justify">
                        <p>Let’s go back 90 years in the year 1929 - the year when all across the world the stock markets had crashed down heavily and the world was staring at the worst recession ever. This continued for a decade which was unprecedented. The United States economy was in a state of shambles with no sign of recovery. When the Britishers were ruling India, they used to impose irrational taxes on the common man to fill their empty coffers. In the present state of the economy and with <strong>Prime Minister Narendra Modi</strong> at the helm of affairs, the common man is once again burdened with taxes.</p>

<p><strong>There are at least three major factors that influence the economy - agriculture being the mainstay followed by manufacturing and consumer industry.</strong> All these industries have gone for a spin with this slowdown. There has been a sharp decline in the growth. The National Council of Applied Economics and Research (NCAER) stated that the real agricultural Gross Value Added (GVA) is envisaged to grow at zero percent, the real industry GVA at 6.1% and the real services GVA at 6.9%. This is the forecast for the year 2019-20. The market is bleeding heavily. Sensex tanked 770 points on Tuesday with a continuous declining GDP growth. It is expected to go down further. This has resulted in a huge loss to investors amounting to 2.55 lakh crores on Tuesday. Today, it faired a little better with rise of 161 points. <strong>The Indian Rupee was at the lowest closing at <code>72.28</code> per dollar since November 2018.</strong></p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi is not an economist and knows very little about the intricacies of the economy. There has hardly been any statement issued by him on this slowdown. <strong>Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman</strong> has her own views on this and has always gives a very muted response when confronted about the present state of economy. The <strong>former Prime Minister and a learned economist, Manmohan Singh</strong> has urged the Prime Minister to seek advice from sane voices but this is all falling on deaf ears. Infact senior <strong>BJP MP, Subramaniam Swamy</strong> went to the extent of saying that we are facing this situation because of the previous UPA government at the Center.</p>

<p>The government has planned a <strong><code>5 trillion dollar</code></strong> economy in the coming <strong>5 years (2019-2024)</strong>. For this the economy will have to grow at more than 14% per annum. But, it is going at a snail’s pace of 5% - as per the data released by the government. Another round of story suggests that this maybe even low to the tune of 2.5% and data could have been manipulated. The reports released just before the elections stated that unemployment is at its worst in the last 45 years. This was also confirmed by the labor ministry. Facts were hidden from the common and the data was manipulated. Two of the National Statistical Commission members - <strong>PC Mohanan</strong> and <strong>JV Meenakshi</strong> resigned stating that the commission was being sidelined and neglected.</p>

<p>My understanding is that there is not going to be any respite from the declining economy in the coming months. One of the worst affected are the Auto and the Real Estate sectors where thousands have lost their jobs. <strong>Infact Maruti has decided to close its plants in Gurgaon and Manesar for two days on 7th and 9th of September.</strong> This is happening for the first time in a decade. Huge real estate inventory is lying unsold with hardly any home buyers. There could be only 2 reasons behind this - no buying capacity or people saving money at the state of things. The Center will have to take serious remedial measures to come out of this rut soon. I feel that some measure should be taken to improve agricultural growth and increase consumption across all sectors. Then only we would be able to subside the declining economy to an extent. As of now, the economy has taken a sabbatical and seems that it&rsquo;s going to be a long one.</p>
