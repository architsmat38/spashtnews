                    <div class="article-post text-justify">
                        <p><strong>It was a grand welcome for Prime Minister Narendra Modi as he kicked off his United States visit from Houston.</strong> The event was witnessed by fifty thousand Indians who had booked their seats much in advance to be a part of this mega event. The entire NRG stadium was a full house show and was chanting Modi’s name as if he was addressing a public rally in India.</p>

<p>Houston is home to about <strong><code>45-47 lakh</code></strong> Indians which amount to a huge Indian vote bank in the United States. Out of this, about 75% - 80% voted for the Democrats in the last elections in the US. Was this event any indication of things to come in the next US Presidential elections. US President Donald Trump is a Republican and is going all out to woo the Houston Indians in his fold. Who could have been a better international personality than PM Modi to help him garner support of the US Indians. In Fact PM Modi surprisingly played host to President Trump and in doing so the glint in his eyes was quite evident.</p>

<p>Now-a-days the camaraderie shared between the leaders of the world’s biggest democracies is very profound in all international meets on which they share the stage. PM Modi’s introduction of President Trump left everyone spell bound including the President himself. The world was watching how this friendship has blossomed and promises to grow in the present times. From Houston, Prime Minister Modi was also targeting the forthcoming Assembly Elections which are scheduled next month in states of Haryana and Maharashtra. The cacophony could be heard from Houston to Haryana. The whole of India was wide awake and glued to their television sets to witness this event which is further going to strengthen India US ties.</p>

<p>Houston is the <strong>&ldquo;Energy capital&rdquo;</strong> of the US. PM Modi held a meeting with seventeen CEOs of energy sector in Houston.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An agreement has been signed with India’s largest Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) importer, Petronet and Houston based Tellurian to invest 2.5 billion dollars for 18% equity in the US energy major’s driftwood project.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The PM had earlier tweeted <strong>&ldquo;It is impossible to come to Houston and not talk energy&rdquo;</strong>. The US is the world’s largest producer of energy with India emerging as a potential market. The energy deals signed will have a great impact on India’s growing energy sector. Further dialogs on bilateral trade will take place when the two leaders meet again at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.</p>

<p>There was a veiled attack on Pakistan by both the leaders regarding terrorism activities carried out by Pakistan. The United States suffered in <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks"><sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub></a></strong> and India suffered on <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Mumbai_attacks"><sup>26</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub></a></strong>. Everybody across the globe understands where terrorism is nurtured. President Trump supported India on the abrogation of <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_370_of_the_Constitution_of_India">Article 370</a></strong> and mentioned that terrorism has no room for dialogs.</p>

<p>The stage show was much of an election campaign for President Trump as he eyes the support of Houston Indians. The President was also all praise for the Prime Minister and bonhomie amongst the two leaders was infectious. He went on to reiterate that India could never find a true friend other than Trump in the US. PM Modi went a step ahead and repeated the slogan of 2016’s US elections - <strong>&ldquo;Abki Baar Trump Sarkar&rdquo;</strong>. Howdy Modi was an opulent event and has gone down very well with the Indians in the US and Houston in particular. PM Modi also sounded the bugle for his own election campaign and will go all out to get support back home in Haryana and Maharashtra. As of now, it is a win-win situation for our Prime Minister across the globe and within the country.</p>
