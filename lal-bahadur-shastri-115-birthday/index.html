                    <div class="article-post text-justify">
                        <p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lal_Bahadur_Shastri">Lal Bahadur Shastri</a></strong> was the second Prime Minister of India. Born on <strong><code>02nd October, 1904</code></strong> in Mughalsarai, his father’s name was Sharda Prasad Shrivastav. He served as India’s Prime Minister after the death of Jawaharlal Nehru from <strong><code>09th June, 1964</code></strong> to <strong><code>11th January, 1966</code></strong> for a period of 18 months. Shastri ji was a phenomenal Prime Minister. He displayed rare qualities like highest level of commitment, responsibility and emotional connect with people.</p>

<p>Earlier India had lost the China war in <strong><code>1962</code></strong> and just after three years India was again at war with Pakistan. But this time Shastriji led from the front and gave Pakistan a befitting reply to its plan of destabilising India. The Pakistan government could not have comprehended it in their wildest dreams. He signed the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tashkent_Declaration">Peace Accord</a></strong> with Pakistan Prime Minister Ayub Khan in Tashkent after the ceasefire was declared. The Accord was signed on <strong><code>11th January, 1966</code></strong>. On the same night he passed away under mysterious circumstances. It was reported to be a cardiac arrest. He rests at Vijay Ghat.</p>

<p><strong>Why is Shastriji’s death a mystery?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Suspected Poisoning</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The KGB (responsible for security of VIPs) suspected that Shastriji was poisoned that night by the butler. When Shastriji’s body was brought to Delhi, it had strange blue patches. The old mother immediately screamed that her son was poisoned. At this time no one in Delhi had a clue what KGB was suspecting.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cuts on body</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The neck and body had some unusual cut marks. The family demanded a clarification in <strong><code>1966</code></strong> but were unsatisfied with what was done. Shastriji’s personal doctor Dr RN Chugh along with his family was run over by a truck. Only the daughter survived but she too was crippled.</p>

<p><img src="/spashtnews/images/lal-bahadur-shastri-115-birthday-1.png" alt="Netaji’s angle to Shastriji’s death" /></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Netaji’s angle to Shastriji’s death</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shastriji never believed Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose was dead. In Fact he showed a lot of interest in Gumnami Baba of Faizabad who was rumoured to be Netaji. It is believed that Netaji was present at Pandit Nehru’s funeral, dressed as a monk and sent a note undersigned as Subhash Chandra Bose to Shastriji. Shastriji immediately ran to meet him. He wanted to set up a second inquiry commission for his death. There was a photo taken during Shastriji’s visit to Tashkent which depicted a man very similar to Netaji. On 12th December 2015, Times of India said that a private face mapping of the mystery man in Tashkent lends support that Netaji and the man in the picture are one and the same person.</p>

<p>The mystery still remains unsolved. The entire nation is celebrating the <strong><code>150th</code></strong> birth anniversary of the Mahatma, but we can not undermine or forget the contributions of Shastriji in the Indian struggle for Independence. Shastriji was <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi’s</a></strong> closest disciple. He was an active participant in all major programs and revolutions and went to jail several times. His contribution in <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-cooperation_movement">Non Cooperation Movement (1920)</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_March#March_to_Dandi">Dandi March (1930)</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quit_India_Movement">Quit India Movement (1942)</a></strong> can never be forgotten. The revolution spread all over India which was unprecedented and proved to be the final nail in the coffin of British rule. Shastriji was inspired by <strong>Purushottam Tandon</strong> and <strong>GB Panth</strong>. He considered them as his political guru. He was close to Nehruji as well. His stature was so big that he was inducted as a Home Minister in Nehru’s cabinet and later became the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Shastriji always mentioned that two progressive pillars of the country are - jawans and kisaans. Thus came into prominence the slogan - <strong><em>Jai Jawan Jai Kisaan</em></strong>. In Fact our generation has grown with the slogan. We should go all out to nurture the legacy of this slogan. How can we forget the song sung by Lata Mangeshkar on <strong>02nd October</strong> which mentions the slogan. The country salutes this thorough gentleman on his <strong><code>115th</code></strong> birth anniversary.</p>
